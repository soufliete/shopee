These connection problems can also result in failure to send and receive files using SHAREit.How to fix this?Before you use Xender and make any transfer using Xender, make sure that all of the VPN apps are closed so, the Xender is able to make the transfer between files and everything occurs seamlessly.If you are connected to any VPN connection, then it is better that you turn it off and then transfer the files afterward so, no problem may occur between the transfer of files.

Due to this, the devices would be having difficulty in communicating and you may be experiencing slow speed.Therefore, it is recommended that you shorten the distance between the devices to increase the transfer speed.Too many Wi-Fi SignalsAnother reason why you could be having a low transfer speed is that there are too many Wi-Fi networks in the area. The place may be very much crowded with Wi-Fi Signals which may interfere with transfer resulting in low transfer speed.Many Apps in the BackgroundIt could be that on either of the device, there are many apps opened in the background that are using the Wi-Fi. All of those apps using the Wi-Fi may result in low transfer speed.Not enough RAMIt may be that one of the devices doesn’t have enough RAM memory or the phone is too slow due to which the transfer speed may be slow.Wi-Fi TechnologyIt may be that one of the devices is very old and has outdated hardware (Wi-Fi Technology) due to which the transfer speed may be slow.
